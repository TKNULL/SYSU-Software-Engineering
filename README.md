## ISSUE

because of the broswer CORS secure issue, I can't set request header to disable cache, the OPTIONS pre-request cause Access-Control-Allow-Methods error, so the update will not show in time, you can use browser debug mode and set disable cache to solve it.

## Thanks

Thanks to someone who maybe will not want his(her) name show here.
