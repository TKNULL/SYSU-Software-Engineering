Some code about MIPS assembly language

## What is MIPS
> MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies . 

The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. Multiple revisions of the MIPS instruction set exist, including MIPS I, MIPS II, MIPS III, MIPS IV, MIPS V, MIPS32, and MIPS64. The current revisions are MIPS32 (for 32-bit implementations) and MIPS64 (for 64-bit implementations). MIPS32 and MIPS64 define a control register set as well as the instruction set.

## USE PCSpim to run MIPS code
> SPIM: A MIPS32 Simulator

> Spim is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this processor. Spim also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of operating system services. Spim does not execute binary (compiled) programs.

As I write these code in windows So I choose PCSpim.
