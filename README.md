## Overview

Central processing unit (CPU), the hardware within a computer that executes a program.

You can use many ways to simulation a cpu, here we choose Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), to do this thing.

## Run & Study

See the subfolder for more infomation about the code.

As about how to run, you can choose the `Xilinx ISE` use the simulation mode or some other name which can run the projects. I recommond you to use the `Icarus Verilog` to do these things, the source file is by `Xilinx ISE` but I last testing run was in `Icarus Verilog`.
