## Overview

So, why must we learn compilers? most programmer, in fact, do not need to write or maintain a compiler, but, the compiler is also a software, learn a complex software is always helpful, what's more, compiler will let you know a lot about relative advanced thinks and skills, for instance, state machine. anyway, I suggest you learn compilers.

This repository's structure list bellow
```
.
├── docs            some documents
├── hardwork        the actual projects
├── homework        the basic part work
└── README.md       introduction
```
I will add many documents in those code, I hope anyone with basic c/cpp knowledge can read those code. 

Good Luck.

## How to use

Read this repository with sequence: `docs -> homework -> hardwork`, in each part, just try to make it run and play with it.
