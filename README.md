# Mini-MIPS-CPU
`jskyzero` `2017/12/22`

## Overview

1. CPU: Central processing unit (CPU), the hardware within a computer that executes a program.

2. Verilog: You can use many ways to simulation a cpu, here we choose Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), to do this thing.

3. MIPS: MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies.

## Run & Study

See the subfolder for more infomation about the code.

As about how to run, you can choose the `Xilinx ISE`, use the simulation mode or some other name which can run the projects. I recommond you to use the `Icarus Verilog` to run only the simple source file, the `1.single_cycle_processor` and `2.multi_cycle_processor` folder is initial created by `Xilinx ISE` but I last edit and test running under `Icarus Verilog`.

## Todo

1. add More commands, maybe some print system call or some thing likely.
2. add a simple compiler which translate these mpis commands to machine language.
3. I don't know when I will do the todos, maybe next next life.
