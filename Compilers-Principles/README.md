## Overview

So, why must we learn compilers? most programmer, in fact, do not need to write or maintain a compiler, but, the compiler is also a software, learn a complex software is always helpful, what's more, compiler will let you know a lot about relative advanced thinks and skills, for instance, state machine. anyway, I suggest you learn compilers.

## Structure
This repository's structure list bellow
```
.
├── docs
├── hardwork
│   └── homework
│       ├── 1.lexical_analysis
│       ├── 2.syntax_analysis
│       └── 3.semantic_analysis
├── projects
│   └── BNF
└── README.md
```
I will add many documents in those code, I hope anyone with basic c/cpp knowledge can read those code. read this repository with sequence: `docs -> homework -> hardwork`, in each part, just try to make it run and play with it.

Good Luck.
