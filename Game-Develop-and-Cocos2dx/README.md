## Install & Run
+ Download: You Can Download From [cocos2d-x.org](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download)
+ Install: 
  ```
  python setup.py
  ```
+ Initial a Cpp Project: 
  ```
  cocos new project_name -l cpp
  ``` 
  Because I install python3.x in windows, so I need to edit `cocos.bat` and change `python` to `py -2`
