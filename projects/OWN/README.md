## about jskyzero's github

I always put Studying and Project codes in github, So you will find many Studying Repositories.

I think the most quick way to re-learning is seeing old code, and I write essential things in those repositories README

## about style
+ Repository Name: begin with uppercase letter and join by `-`.
+ Folder and File Name: use lower case letters and join by `_` if need. (First Think The Language Initial Name Style)
+ License: Study Repositories has no license, About Others, most of them are MIT lincese, or others on purpose.
+ When to Update: I don't know and I can't make promise.
